missing implementations and features for a better security and usage

## UUID
change Id identifier to UUID (higher security), but keep id as primary key in database

## Logging
implement serverside logging

## Pagination
load data in batches to reduce data traffic (changes in frontend required)

## Picture
implement upload of pictures (profile picture as well as product pictures)
change name after upload to random string and save it in corresponding entity table (user, productimages)

## Modal
afer permission modal closes information modal openes directly, not beautiful animation

## secure backend
remove unnecessary routes and functions, pre authorize as much as possible

## Validation
check if request comes from valid user with right permission (admin can update users, only user who owns an auction can update auction, ...)
in the registration process, implement checks if user is real, no automated registration
